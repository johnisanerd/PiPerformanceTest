# PiPerformanceTest

Some testing scripts for the Pi using [sysbench.](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench)

These can be used to test the performance of the Pi or any Debian Linux system.  I'm writing them to try to get the power consumption up on a Raspberry Pi power supply to make sure it can supply enough power for a heavily-running system.
