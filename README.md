# PiPerformanceTest

Some testing scripts for the Pi using sysbench.

These can be used to test the performance of the Pi or any Debian Linux system.  I'm writing them to try to get the power consumption up on a Raspberry Pi power supply to make sure it can supply enough power for a heavily-running system.
